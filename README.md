# Echoes of the Past: Exploring Dinosaur Fossil Records and Cinematic Successes

## Project Overview

This project combines two distinct yet fascinating areas of analysis: dinosaur fossil records and classic Hollywood films. By investigating these datasets, we aim to provide valuable insights for a natural history museum and a major movie studio. The goal is to enhance the understanding of ancient life and uncover patterns that contributed to the success of timeless cinematic masterpieces.
