# # Everyone Can Learn Data Scholarship

# %% [markdown]
# ## üìñ Background
# The second "Everyone Can Learn Data" Scholarship from DataCamp is now open for entries. 
# 
# The challenges below test your coding skills you gained from beginner courses on either Python, R, or SQL. Pair them **with the help of AI** and your **creative thinking skills** and win **$5,000** for your future data science studies!
# 
# The scholarship is open to secondary and undergraduate students, and other students preparing for graduate-level studies (getting their Bachelor degree). Postgraduate students (PhDs) or graduated students (Master degree) cannot apply. 
# 
# The challenge consist of two parts, make sure to complete both parts before submitting. Good luck!

# # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Part 1 (Python) - Dinosaur data ü¶ï
# 
# ## üìñ Background
# You're applying for a summer internship at a national museum for natural history. The museum recently created a database containing all dinosaur records of past field campaigns. Your job is to dive into the fossil records to find some interesting insights, and advise the museum on the quality of the data. 

# %% [markdown]
# ## üíæ The data
# 
# ### You have access to a real dataset containing dinosaur records from the Paleobiology Database ([source](https://paleobiodb.org/#/)):
# 
# 
# | Column name | Description |
# |---|---|
# | occurence_no | The original occurrence number from the Paleobiology Database. |
# | name | The accepted name of the dinosaur (usually the genus name, or the name of the footprint/egg fossil). |
# | diet | The main diet (omnivorous, carnivorous, herbivorous). |
# | type | The dinosaur type (small theropod, large theropod, sauropod, ornithopod, ceratopsian, armored dinosaur). |
# | length_m | The maximum length, from head to tail, in meters. |
# | max_ma | The age in which the first fossil records of the dinosaur where found, in million years. |
# | min_ma | The age in which the last fossil records of the dinosaur where found, in million years. |
# | region | The current region where the fossil record was found. |
# | lng | The longitude where the fossil record was found. |
# | lat | The latitude where the fossil record was found. |
# | class | The taxonomical class of the dinosaur (Saurischia or Ornithischia). |
# | family | The taxonomical family of the dinosaur (if known). |
# 
# The data was enriched with data from Wikipedia.

# %% [markdown]
# ## üí™ Challenge I
# Help your colleagues at the museum to gain insights on the fossil record data. Include:
# 
# 
# 1. How many different dinosaur names are present in the data?
# 2. Which was the largest dinosaur? What about missing data in the dataset?
# 3. What dinosaur type has the most occurrences in this dataset? Create a visualization (table, bar chart, or equivalent) to display the number of dinosaurs per type. Use the AI assistant to tweak your visualization (colors, labels, title...).
# 4. Did dinosaurs get bigger over time? Show the relation between the dinosaur length and their age to illustrate this.
# 5. Use the AI assitant to create an interactive map showing each record. 
# 6. Any other insights you found during your analysis?

# # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Part 2 (SQL) - Understanding movie data üé• 
# 
# ## üìñ Background
# You have just been hired by a large movie studio to perform data analysis. Your manager, an executive at the company, wants to make new movies that "recapture the magic of old Hollywood." So you've decided to look at the most successful films that came out before Titanic in 1997 to identify patterns and help generate ideas that could turn into future successful films.

# %% [markdown]
# ## üíæ The data
# 
# ### You have access to the following table, _**cinema.films**_:
# 
# | Column name | Description |
# |---|---|
# | id | Unique movie identifier. |
# | title | The title of the movie. |
# | release_year | The year the movie was released to the public. |
# | country | The country in which the movie was released. |
# | duration | The runtime of the movie, in minutes. |
# | language | The original language the movie was produced in. |
# | certification | The [rating](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system) the movie was given based on their suitability for audiences. |
# | gross | The revenue the movie generated at the box office, in USD. |
# | budget | The available budget the production had for producing the movie, in USD. |
# 
# The data was sourced from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/).

# ## üí™ Challenge II
# Help your team leader understand the data that's available in the _cinema.films_ dataset. Include:
# 
# 1. How many movies are present in the database?
# 2. There seems to be a lot of missing data in the gross and budget columns. How many rows have missing data? What would you recommend your manager to do with these rows?
# 3. How many different certifications or ratings are present in the database?
# 4. What are the top five countries in terms of number of movies produced?
# 5. What is the average duration of English versus French movies? (Don't forget you can use the AI assistant!)
# 6. Any other insights you found during your analysis?
